Healthcare Text-to-SQL

This project explores building a Text-to-SQL system tailored for healthcare data. The goal is to bridge the gap between natural language queries and structured SQL, enabling users to interact with healthcare databases more intuitively.

The system uses a multi-agent approach where different agents collaborate to:
    Understand natural language queries,
    Plan the query structure,
    Generate corresponding SQL,
    Validate correctness against the schema

Highlights :
    Focused on healthcare datasets (patients, visits, medications, etc.),
    Modular and extensible design for query handling,
    Demonstrates how natural language can be transformed into structured database queries,
    Implemented and tested in a Kaggle notebook for reproducibility
